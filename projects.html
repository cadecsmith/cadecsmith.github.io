                <h3>Dominican Republic General Reference Map</h3>
                <p>
                    As part of a cartographic design class at BYU, I created a general map of the Dominican Republic using ArcGIS Pro. This was one of my first attempts at a large general reference map that included physical and human features.

                <h3>America's Rock Climbing Maps</h3>
                <p>
                    I created several maps to map the spatial distribution of rock climbing in the United States, 
                    using several different variables and data from popular climbing website <a href = "mountainproject.com">MountainProject</a>. This project aimed to find spatial correlation of amount and type of rock climbing by state.

                <h3>Uinta Wasatch Timber Harvest</h3>
                <p>
                    I performed a suitability analysis for timber harvest in the Uinta Wasatch Cache National Forest.
                    This project involved creating a map of suitable areas for timber harvest based on slope, aspect, and
                    distance from roads.
