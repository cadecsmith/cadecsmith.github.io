                <h3>Dominican Republic General Reference Map</h3>
                <p>
                    As part of a cartographic design class at BYU, I created a general map of the Dominican Republic using ArcGIS Pro.
                     This was one of my first attempts at a large general reference map that included physical and human features.

                <h3>America's Rock Climbing Maps</h3>
                <p>
                    I created several maps to map the spatial distribution of rock climbing in the United States, 
                    using several different variables and data from popular climbing website <a href = "mountainproject.com">MountainProject</a>. 
                    This project aimed to find spatial correlation of amount and type of rock climbing by state.

                <h3>Uinta Wasatch Timber Harvest</h3>
                <p>
                    I performed a suitability analysis for timber harvest in the Uinta Wasatch Cache National Forest.
                    This project involved creating a map of suitable areas for timber harvest based on slope, aspect, and
                    distance from roads.

                <h3>Utah Resort Suitability Index</h3>
                <p>
                    I created a suitability index for a hypothetical luxury resort in Utah based on several factors like
                    distance to national parks and recreation areas, slope, and distance from roads.
                    This project was a great way to practice spatial analysis and suitability modeling.

                    As a research assistant for a professor at BYU, I created a poster with several maps of statistical 
                    correlation between risk factors for aflatoxin in corn in northern Texas.

              <h3>Personal Fishing Database</h3>
              <p>
               For my own personal use, I created a web map to log all fish I have caught along with information like the lure,
                time of day, weather, and size and species of the fish. This project was a great way to practice web mapping and database management.
